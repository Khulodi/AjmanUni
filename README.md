### Part 2
Your second challenge is to complete the html form. Currently the form takes your first name as an input, and on submitting the form, a greeting is generated based on the first name.
Add another input to include one's second name. The second name should also appear in the greeting text on submitting the form. Make sure to modify the Html and Javascript files.
